# CEC Projects
## This Repository contains two projects -

### 1. Image Rotation
This project accepts an Image and an angle by which the image is to be rotated and finally displays both the images.

### 2. Sudoku Solver
Sudoku is a puzzle game that needs no introduction. This project is used to solve a simple sudoku puzzle.

## System Requirements -
A basic C++ compiler is required (I've used MINGW).
For the first project, Opencv-C++ Library is also required.
